SetCounters
===========

Similar to ARModel.update_counters, ARModel.set_counters simply sets multiple
fields to their integer values. No adding/substracting, just setting.
Yes, this could be done using update_all, but this seems nicer to me.


Example
=======

# For the Post with id of 5, set the comment_count to 1, and
# set the action_count to 2

Post.set_counters 5, :comment_count => 1, :action_count => 2

# Executes the following SQL:
# UPDATE posts
#    SET comment_count = 1,
#        action_count = 2
#  WHERE id = 5
